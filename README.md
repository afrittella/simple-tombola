## Simple Tombola

Due to COVID-19 we can't play the classical italian board game known as "Tombola".

So I created this simple application that shows a Tombola board.

The project was created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because it will be improved later with:
- rooms and players management;
- real-time board for online players
- detect "ambo, terno etc.". :)
