## Simple Tombola

Due to COVID-19 we couldn't play the classic italian board game known as "Tombola" with our relatives.

So I created a simple application to play our "family game" online. :)

The project was created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.org):

- tests
- rooms and players management
- real-time board for online players
- ~~detect "ambo, terno etc.".~~

## Execute
Clone the project and type `npm run dev`, then go to `localhost:3000`
